<p>The default <b>Color Scheme</b> <span class="RefNumber">3</span> is "Blue Print" You can also select a Parchment or Classic version. Custom color schemes can be made by choosing your colors by clicking on the color boxes next to the following text entries: "Background Color", "Default Grid Color" and "Default sub-grid Color". You can also adjust the highlight percentage for the selected parts and for the single part you grab in a group of selected parts. The result of your color settings will be shown in the preview window. The changes will not take effect until after press the "Ok" button.</p>

<p>You can also set the <b>default text format</b> <span class="RefNumber">4</span> (font style and color) which will be used each time you create a new text on your map.</p>

<p>Similarly you can set the default settings for each new grid layer <span class="RefNumber">5</span> and each new area layer <span class="RefNumber">6</span>. To tune the default ruler style see the <a href="Preferences_Edition.htm">Edition Preference</a> section.</p>
