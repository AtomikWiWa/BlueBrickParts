<title>Exporting a Layout as an Image</title>

<h1>Exporting a Layout as an Image</h1>

<p>Exporting a Layout as an Image can be handy when you do not, or can not print your layout and you need to show your layout on hardware that either does not have, or cannot support BlueBrick.  It is also useful if you want to add your layouts to picture archives (e.g. Online). This feature can be found in the <span class="path">&nbsp;file &gt; export picture...&nbsp;</span> menu or simply by pressing CTRL+E.</p>

<h2>Export Options</h2>

<p>The watermark will also be exported by default at the bottom right of each image, unless you uncheck the checkbox <span class="RefNumber">1</span>. Electric circuit and connection points can also be exported with the checkboxes <span class="RefNumber">2</span> and <span class="RefNumber">3</span>.</p>

<p>The options window gives you the possibility to select the section of your layout which you want to have exported. Simply click and drag the mouse over the image to place a red frame around the area you want to export. You can make a more precise selection by modifying the "Area Size in Studs" values <span class="RefNumber">4</span>.</p>

<h2>Image size and count</h2>

<p>Once you have selected the area of your layout that you want to export, you should specify the size and the number of images to which your layout should be exported. The fields <span class="RefNumber">5</span> let you specify in how many rows and columns the export should be split. For example if you specify 3 in width and 2 in height, then 6 images will be exported. Spliting your export in multiple images can be usefull if you have a very large layout and still want to keep a reasonable picture resolution.</p>

<p>Then you can specify the size of the exported image(s) in pixel <span class="RefNumber">6</span> or the image(s) resolution <span class="RefNumber">7</span>, i.e. how many pixels for drawing one stud (knowing that the native resolution of BlueBrick is 8 pixels per stud, so if you go above that value, you won't have more details in the exported image, except for the texts and rulers). Note that each time you type in one of the three values, the two others may be recomputed automatically as they are linked. For example the higher is your pixel/stud resolution, and the bigger the image will be; or if you specify a fixed size, BlueBrick will recompute the needed resolution to fit the layout in that size. The image size and resolution will be the same for all the exported images if you set more than one row or column.</p>

<p>Supported file types are .bmp, .jpg, .gif and .png, and the maximum image size allowed by BlueBrick is 4096 x 4096 pixels. If you want to create a bigger image of your layout, increase the row or column count to export in multiple images, then reassemble them in your favorite image editor software.</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>

<p>Printing the layout can be done by printing the image you saved using the <span class="path">&nbsp;file &gt; export picture...&nbsp;</span> feature. You can open the picture using the standard picture viewing software provided with your operating system and print it from there.</p>
