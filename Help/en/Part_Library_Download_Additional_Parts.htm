<h1>How to download additional parts or update the Part Library</h1>

<p>You can ask BlueBrick to check online if it can find some additional parts packages, or if some part packages have been updated. Part packages are stored in sub folders of the "parts" folder, and will appear as tabs in the part library. In order to do this, go to <span class="path">&nbsp;File &gt; Download Additional Parts... &nbsp;</span> which will open the following pop up window:</p>

<p>In this option window you can specify which type of part packages you want to search, by checking the checkbox you want.
<ul>
	<li><b>Search in the Official Package Library</b>: if you check this option, BlueBrick will search on the official BlueBrick website, for any genuine LEGO parts packages (track, baseplate, sets, etc...), but also for non genuine LEGO parts, such as custom train tracks made by third party but compatible with LEGO track, and hosted on the BlueBrick website. If you have created a package that you think should be part of the official BlueBrick library, please contact Alban, and he may host your package on the BlueBrick website, if it is suitable.</li>
	<li><b>Search in the Official non-LEGO Package Library</b>: if you check this option, BlueBrick will search for non-LEGO parts but officially hosted on the BlueBrick website. If you are a LEGO fan, you probably don't want to check this option. However, since BlueBrick is a versatile software, it can be used to create train layout for other toy brands, such as for example, Playmobil, Plarail (from Tomy) or Wooden Track from Ikea (or compatible toy makers).</li>
	<li><b>Search in an Unofficial Third Party Package Library</b>: You may want to use this option, if for example your LUG/LTC has created a package for layout planning internal to your LUG/LTC. This package may contains for example modules built on a specific internal template. This package would probably be uploaded somewhere online, such as on the website of the LUG/LTC. In such case, you can check this item, and provide the URL of the folder containing the zip package (the folder can contains several zip files).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once you have selected the online sources for searching the packages you want, make sure you are connected to internet and that your firewall authorize BlueBrick to access to internet, and click the <span class="path">Search for Package Libraries</span> button, then wait a moment. Some feedback will be provided above the button on the progress of the connection. Once BlueBrick has finished to search and if it found any package, the follwing download center window will be displayed:</p>

<center><img src="Download_Center_For_Parts.png"></center>

<p>In this window you can select which package you want to download or update with the check mark <span class="RefNumber">1</span>. In the column <span class="RefNumber">2</span> you can see the name of the package. In the column <span class="RefNumber">3</span>, you can see the version number of the package available online. If you already have that package installed, it will be listed here only if the version number online is higher than the version number of your installed package. In the such case, the update of this package will totally replace your currently installed package. Finally the column <span class="RefNumber">4</span> shows the URL of the package, so if you don't want to let BlueBrick download and install the package for you, you can also download it manually.</p>

<p>Once you are ready, click on the <span class="path">Start Download</span> button and wait for the download to complete, follwing the progress bar next to the button. When the installation is complete the <span class="path">Cancel</span> button is changed to <span class="path">Close</span>, and you can click on it to close the download form window. Then a pop-up message will inform you that the Part Library need to be reloaded, and after the reload the new parts should now be available.</p>
