<h1>The Part Library</h1>

<P>In this chapter you can find how to use the Part Library. This includes a description of its <A HREF="Part_Library_Organization.htm">organization and some display preferences</A> and also <A HREF="Part_Library_How_to_Filter.htm">how to filter it</A> in order to find a specific part more easily.</P>

<P>But if you are looking for creating and adding some new parts to the Part Library, please read the <A HREF="How_to_extend_the_Part_Library.htm">How to extend the Part Library</A> section. Alternatively, if you just want to group some existing parts and save your arrangement in the Library for later use, please read the <A HREF="Part_Library_Save_a_Group_in_the_Library.htm">How to save a group in the Library</A> section. Later on if you want to share your new parts and contribute to the official Part Library please <A HREF="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=33157">visit the Eurobricks forum here</A>.</P>
